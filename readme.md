# JAREL Arduino Library
### Just Another Rotary Encoder Library

JAREL is a fork of [MPrograms](https://github.com/mprograms/)'s [SimpleRotary](https://github.com/mprograms/SimpleRotary/) Arduino Encoder library, aiming to add more functionality to an already great library.
Refer to SimpleRotary's [README](https://github.com/mprograms/SimpleRotary/blob/master/readme.md) for all info and to SimpleRotary's repo for [examples](https://https://github.com/mprograms/SimpleRotary/tree/master/examples).
